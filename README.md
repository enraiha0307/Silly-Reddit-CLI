# Silly-Reddit-CLI
A really basic CLI which outputs a random post on terminal or in the browser according to what flag we pass.

I made this CLI during  "Introduction to Nodejs, v2" course by "Scott Moss".
You can also refer to his notes [here](https://intro-to-nodejs-v2-site.vercel.app/lesson/09-clis)
